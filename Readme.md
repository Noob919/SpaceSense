<h1 style="font-size:36px;">Problem Statement</h1>
The EuroSAT land cover classification dataset contains 27,000 labeled satellite images of different land cover types, such as forest, farmland, urban, etc. The task is to classify these images into their respective classes. In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was trained on this dataset using the Keras API in Python.
<h1 style="font-size:36px;">Dataset Preparation:</h1>
The EuroSAT dataset was downloaded from the link provided in the task description. The dataset contains 10 folders, where each folder represents a different land cover type. A total of 27,000 images were present in the dataset, with 2700 images in each folder. The images were resized to 64x64 pixels and then normalized to the range of 0 to 1.

<h1 style="font-size:36px;">Model Architecture:</h1>

* Input layer - a 2D convolutional layer with 32 filters of size 3x3, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, with an input shape of (64, 64, 3) corresponding to the image dimensions and color channels.
* Max pooling layer - reduces the spatial size of the output of the previous convolutional layer by taking the maximum value over 2x2 pixel neighborhoods.
* 2D convolutional layer - another 2D convolutional layer with 64 filters of size 3x3, and ReLU activation function.
* Another max pooling layer - again reduces the spatial size of the output of the previous convolutional layer.
* 2D convolutional layer - a third 2D convolutional layer with 128 filters of size 3x3, and ReLU activation function.
* Another max pooling layer - again reduces the spatial size of the output of the previous convolutional layer.
* Flatten layer - flattens the output of the previous max pooling layer to a one-dimensional vector.
* Dense layer - a fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation function.
* Dropout layer - randomly sets a fraction of the input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.
* Output layer - a dense layer with 10 neurons, corresponding to the number of classes in the EuroSAT dataset, and a softmax activation function, which produces probabilities for each class.

<h1 style="font-size:36px;">Training:</h1>
The EarlyStopping callback monitors the validation loss and stops training if the loss does not improve for a specified number of epochs. 
The ModelCheckpoint callback saves the best model based on the validation accuracy during training.The model is then trained using the fit() method with a batch size of 64 and for a total of 30 epochs, while also passing the defined callbacks to monitor the training progress.
The optimizer used was Adam, and the loss function used was categorical cross-entropy. The training accuracy and loss were monitored during the training process using the TensorBoard callback in Keras.

<h1 style="font-size:36px;">Evaluation:</h1>
After training the model, it was evaluated on the validation set. The evaluation metrics used were accuracy. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 89.12% on the validation set, which is a good performance for a multi-class classification problem.

<h1 style="font-size:36px;">Inference:</h1>
A separate Jupyter notebook was created for performing inference on 20 sample images from the EuroSAT dataset. The CNN model was loaded from the saved weights, and the predictions were made on the sample images. 
<h1 style="font-size:36px;">Conclusion:</h1>
In conclusion, a CNN model was trained on the EuroSAT land cover classification dataset using the Keras API in Python. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 93.5% on the train set and doesn't performed that well on the sample images. The model can be further fine-tuned to improve its performance or used for other land cover classification tasks.Some future improvement are mention in the next section.

<h1 style="font-size:36px;">Constraints of the current solution:</h1>

* **Limited dataset size:** The EuroSAT dataset used in this solution contains only 27,000 images. While this is a reasonably large dataset, it may not be sufficient to capture the full range of variations in land cover across Europe. This could limit the model's ability to generalize well to new data.
* **Limited model complexity:** The current model architecture is relatively simple, with only three convolutional layers and one dense layer. While this architecture is capable of achieving decent accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset, it may not be powerful enough to capture more complex patterns in other datasets or applications.

<h1 style="font-size:36px;">Potential improvements to the solution:</h1>

* **Increase the depth of the model:** Adding more convolutional layers to the model can increase its capacity to learn more complex features from the input images.
* **Use regularization techniques:** Regularization techniques like dropout, L1/L2 regularization can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model.
* **Use data augmentation:** Data augmentation techniques like random rotation, flipping, zooming, and cropping can artificially increase the size of the dataset and make the model more robust to variations in the input images.
* **Use transfer learning:** Transfer learning can help leverage the pre-trained models on large datasets like ImageNet to improve the performance of the model on smaller datasets like EuroSAT.
* **Use ensemble learning:** Ensemble learning can help improve the performance of the model by combining multiple models' predictions.
